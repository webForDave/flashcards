# Flashcard Study API
> Study smarter, not harder (okay, maybe a little harder).

A simple but powerful API to create, organize, and study flashcards. Build decks, add Q&A cards, track progress, and study smarter with endpoints designed for active recall and spaced repetition.

## Features
* Create, edit, and delete decks
* Add, update, and remove flashcards
* Review cards in study mode
* Mark cards as known/unknown
* Track study progress
* Categorize with subjects and tags
* Optional: spaced repetition + deck sharing

## Why this project?
Flashcards = memory gains.
This API gives developers an easy way to integrate flashcard based studying into apps without reinventing the wheel.

## Tech Stack
* Node.js + Express
* MongoDB + Mongoose
* JWT auth + bcrypt for security

## Example Flow
1. Create a deck → “Biology Chapter 1”

2. Add flashcards → “Q: Powerhouse of the cell? A: Mitochondria”

3. Study cards → mark as known/unknown

4. Track progress → 75% mastered
